I live in New York City and work at Blackstone as a Data Scientist, focused on building agentic AI tools and automated analytics software to support our investors.

I'm currently working on:
- A new board game that combines deck building and territory control
- [web-deckbuilding](https://github.com/ryanbbrown/web-deckbuilding) and [hexmap](https://github.com/ryanbbrown/hex-graph) to help me iterate on my board game more quickly
- AI-powered redesign of one of my favorite games, Race for the Galaxy
 
I have the unreasonable goal of reading every major fantasy series ever written (as per the list from [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jjif55/rfantasy_top_novels_2025_results/)), and am currently finishing up The Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb.

A few things I like:
- **Productivity:** full tech setup here
- **Reading:** booklist here
- **Board Games:** playlog here
