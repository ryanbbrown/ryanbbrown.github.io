I care a lot about the tools I use and frequently try out new ones or try to optimize my existing tools. 

## Development

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): I used to use Claude Code from within Cursor, but I wasn’t really using Cursor Tab and I like having my AI terminal popped out as a separate window (Cursor’s is buggy when zooming).
- [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code): I use the Tavily MCP for web search and have a web search subagent so my main context doesn’t get bloated with search results. I’ve experimented with more subagents but haven’t found it particularly beneficial for my use cases; I get more lift from session management.

## **AI**

- [ChatGPT Desktop](https://chatgpt.com/features/desktop/): Works well enough, I haven’t seen anything compelling enough from the other players to make me switch. I like having a dedicated app, even though it’s sometimes slightly lacking in feature parity vs. the web client.
- [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/): Email client and to-do list. At $30/month Superhuman is *pricy* and I don’t even use the AI features, but I like having a modern, snappy, dedicated email client with keyboard shortcuts. I send myself emails as to-do items because I’m too forgetful for two separate apps.
- [Monologue](https://www.monologue.to/): Voice to text anywhere your cursor is. Even though I can type ~140wpm, it requires a lot more focus than speaking and is less fluid. I’m slowly starting to talk more and type less. Monologue is the first app for this that I found and it works well enough for me at $10/month, I haven’t tried others.

## **General Productivity**

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/): After a long journey with Obsidian, Dendron, and OneNote (back when I was using Windows), I’ve settled back on Notion. Markdown-like notes have become a must for me and I actually like the simplicity of just having a single database page for knowledge management. I also use it as a CMS for this site, which is nice.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): I’m not a stickler for security and Chrome is familiar. I don’t think I have a strong use case for an AI browser (yet).
- [Charmstone](https://charmstone.app/): App switcher / launcher. Having essentially one keyboard shortcut to access 8 different apps is convenient and heavily satisfying for my keyboard shortcut obsession.
- [Maccy](https://maccy.app/): Clipboard history. Not having to go back and re-copy text comes in handy more often than you’d think.
