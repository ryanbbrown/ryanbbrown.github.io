## üèÖ Competition Overview

The Dell Data Hackathon was hosted by MISA (Management Information Systems Association) and NOBE (National Organization for Business and Engineering) on October 18, 2020, and was sponsored by Dell. Participation was open to all students, and 12 teams competed. My team received first place.

### **The Challenge**

COVID-19 barged its way onto the world stage earlier this year and has fundamentally altered all of our daily lives. Every day we are flooded with news of climbing global infection rates and mounting death tolls. According to behavior psychologist Michael Mazius, Ph.D., we have become accustomed to the pandemic ‚Äúto the point of habituation and even desensitization‚Äù.

Despite this ‚ÄúCOVID fatigue‚Äù, we are not out of this crisis yet. For the sakes of our friends and families, it is important to remain diligent in practicing safety measures. This case is intended to explore the more immediate impact of this virus on our local Austin community. **Your task:** Predict the **growth of infections** for this holiday season (Thanksgiving Nov 26th ‚Äì New Year‚Äôs Jan 1st) within **Greater Austin**.
